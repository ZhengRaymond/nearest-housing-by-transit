Pets accept on case by case basis. Renter pays utilities. Deposit is $695 deposit + $200 pet deposit. \n\n**I need some work done around the house and would be interested in bartering for the down payment and a sooner move in date. \n\nWe are not giving out exact address yet until application time, it is in Parkway School District, has clean W/W carpet, Wood Deck, Solid well insulated, with aluminum siding, low utility bills. Typically rent is $700 per month, without any pets, this is adjustable for someone who will actually do the requested work wanted done. We will reimburse tenants as work gets completed, so if say painting is done within 1st 30 days next months rent will be reduced proportionately for every month thereafter, resulting in substantially lower monthly rents through out lease term, each time a job is completed rent drops more. The more you complete the more your monthly rent goes down. This will all be done in contract form and notarized for everyone's assurance at lease time.

Through the dining area, off the kitchen, a sliding glass door leads you outside onto a composite deck, then down onto a great patio with privacy for your outdoor entertaining.  Here you will see a back up generator, so if the power goes out, in a few short seconds you are back up and running.  Another great feature you will find is a Weber Genisis grill that is included with the property.  What makes it unique is that it is hooked straight into the gas supply of the home.  Never run out of propane in your tank in the middle of grilling that perfect meal again.  \nBack inside from the tiled foyer you will find a main floor laundry with ample space and shelving.  This laundry is complete with Maytag oversized capacity washer and dryer.  From the foyer you will find entrances to 3 bedrooms with great closet space. The master bedroom boasts a master bath with shower, a sink with sit down vanity and walk in closet.  \nThe hall bath upstairs features a tub shower combo.  \nDownstairs features a large basement, wet bar and large rec room.  There is a bonus room with another walk in closet as well as another full bath with tub shower combo.  Two storage closets can also be found downstairs, one housing a utility sink, water softener, high efficiency furnace and 40 gallon hot water tank.  \nOther notable features include an attic fan for the days not warm enough to run the central air and a two car garage with gentle sloping driveway.  All this offered for $1800 per month. This executive townhome is a must see.","mapUrl":"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@39.789300,-94.804300,16z","pid":"6390547466","replyUrl":{"slashes":false,"protocol":"","hash":"","query":"","pathname":"/reply/stj/apa/6390547466","auth":"","host":"","port":"","hostname":"stjoseph.craigslist.org","password":"","username":"","origin":"null","href":"/reply/stj/apa/6390547466"},"title":"Executive Townhome For Rent: 3 Bedroom, 3 Bathroom","url":"https://stjoseph.craigslist.org/apa/d/executive-townhome-for-rent-3/6390547466.html","postedAt":"2017-11-17T15:59:21.000Z","updatedAt":"2017-12-11T18:07:00.000Z","images":["https://images.craigslist.org/00t0t_loQmonusPaK_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00N0N_6cppIAvTJaR_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00Z0Z_5UKAIMVfrWC_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/01010_jGBSWmhWfNu_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00B0B_4P3hiwjj25D_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00000_8p8Wsou1hb5_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00707_eGqf1pguzJg_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00000_eIvDfpFMrdl_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00a0a_8TfzGKeP8V3_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00Q0Q_cA8snAGCo5A_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00909_ez8T9bDn7qI_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_1Q5KHP9MNlf_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00d0d_3SgnWXNuJ1C_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_gQCob6rTdDE_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00Q0Q_igU4waq5JqP_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/01010_lj36Td6baAo_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00W0W_4S8xAVy9qD9_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_a2eZmjzwYmz_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00M0M_c6hkSIutYUy_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00W0W_59ySjbkNKAZ_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00j0j_hi7cuHUJx5d_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00Q0Q_kKewcF64Alp_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00c0c_4Keammr72QV_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00Y0Y_1WfOOVdl3yW_600x450.jpg"],"attributes":{}},{"description":"QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nrent 2 own.

It is a 2 month lease assignment from 12/15/2017 - 2/14/2018, after which you'll have the opportunity to discuss a longer term lease with the landlord if you chose.\n\nThis is the perfect solution if you are looking for a short-term space. The building is 3+ years old and has a ton of great amenities (24 hour doorman, full gym & yoga studio included in rent, roof top lounge with outdoor grills & awesome NYC skyline views, modern stainless steel kitchen appliances, basketball court, outdoor garden, 2 large elevators, laundry room, etc.). The building is also pet friendly, so dogs and cats are not a problem. It is located steps away from the Court Square - 7/E/G/M lines making it extremely convenient to commute anywhere (door to Grand Central in 10 mins). There are a ton of great restaurants and things to do in the area as well (short walk to Gantry State Park, across the Street from MoMA PS1, etc.). \n\nThe rent is $2,900 per month and we are offering a $300 per month incentive for a net rent of $2,600 per month. The building will also require a one month security deposit and a $25 application fee.\n\nIf you are looking for the unit to be furnished, we can leave furniture including a full sized bed, mattress, dresser, table and chairs.\n\nEmail to view today!","mapUrl":"https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+Pearson+St+at+Jackson+Ave+Long+Island+City+NY+US","pid":"6413228358","replyUrl":{"slashes":false,"protocol":"","hash":"","query":"","pathname":"/reply/nyc/sub/6413228358","auth":"","host":"","port":"","hostname":"newyork.craigslist.org","password":"","username":"","origin":"null","href":"/reply/nyc/sub/6413228358"},"title":"NO FEE 1BR SUBLET in LIC - AVAILABLE 12/15","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/que/sub/d/no-fee-1br-sublet-in-lic/6413228358.html","postedAt":"2017-12-05T14:21:50.000Z","updatedAt":"2017-12-11T20:57:34.000Z","images":["https://images.craigslist.org/00S0S_9zD6Miquqbr_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00K0K_apXdZqYcmTj_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00F0F_h3AcFKDYcTI_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00I0I_vwtSdRWfT8_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00g0g_dhRC3pQoTY3_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00909_7Ce6u5QVLCR_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00I0I_lXzRQk5nLoG_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00e0e_cHw4NuynIr9_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00B0B_bxS1oiKSgWS_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00C0C_kpSQd2UoTiR_600x450.jpg"],"attributes":{}},{"description":"QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nLooking for roomie in 20s\nBUSHWICK AND STANHOPE\n1 YEAR LEASE\nsmall room with closet in room share building\nsuper location and very convenient neighborhood\n\nkitchen has a fridge, microwave and hotplate \nhard wood floor\nsloped ceiling\nall utilities included\nEXCELLENT CREDIT (680+) AND INCOME (40X) OR USE A GUARANTOR\nsecurity, first month's rent and $60 app fee to move in\nEMAIL ME TO VIEW OR VIEW VIDEO","mapUrl":"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@40.690700,-73.927400,16z","pid":"6421590589","replyUrl":{"slashes":false,"protocol":"","hash":"","query":"","pathname":"/reply/nyc/roo/6421590589","auth":"","host":"","port":"","hostname":"newyork.craigslist.org","password":"","username":"","origin":"null","href":"/reply/nyc/roo/6421590589"},"title":"I'm looking for a TRUE minimalist for the last great priced room","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/roo/d/im-looking-for-true/6421590589.html","postedAt":"2017-12-11T20:55:32.000Z","images":["https://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_lVoKGEStLSe_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00606_78cI37Mkllm_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00r0r_cvFvR11OfgA_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00n0n_1WdmtZbrQhc_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00s0s_YC5V0nX6Of_600x450.jpg"],"attributes":{}},{"description":"QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nWelcome to Riverdale's own River Point Towers!
