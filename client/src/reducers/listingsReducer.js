It is a 2 month lease assignment from 12/15/2017 - 2/14/2018, after which you'll have the opportunity to discuss a longer term lease with the landlord if you chose.\n\nThis is the perfect solution if you are looking for a short-term space. The building is 3+ years old and has a ton of great amenities (24 hour doorman, full gym & yoga studio included in rent, roof top lounge with outdoor grills & awesome NYC skyline views, modern stainless steel kitchen appliances, basketball court, outdoor garden, 2 large elevators, laundry room, etc.). The building is also pet friendly, so dogs and cats are not a problem. It is located steps away from the Court Square - 7/E/G/M lines making it extremely convenient to commute anywhere (door to Grand Central in 10 mins). There are a ton of great restaurants and things to do in the area as well (short walk to Gantry State Park, across the Street from MoMA PS1, etc.). \n\nThe rent is $2,900 per month and we are offering a $300 per month incentive for a net rent of $2,600 per month. The building will also require a one month security deposit and a $25 application fee.\n\nIf you are looking for the unit to be furnished, we can leave furniture including a full sized bed, mattress, dresser, table and chairs.\n\nEmail to view today!","mapUrl":"https://maps.google.com/?q=loc%3A+Pearson+St+at+Jackson+Ave+Long+Island+City+NY+US","pid":"6413228358","replyUrl":{"slashes":false,"protocol":"","hash":"","query":"","pathname":"/reply/nyc/sub/6413228358","auth":"","host":"","port":"","hostname":"newyork.craigslist.org","password":"","username":"","origin":"null","href":"/reply/nyc/sub/6413228358"},"title":"NO FEE 1BR SUBLET in LIC - AVAILABLE 12/15","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/que/sub/d/no-fee-1br-sublet-in-lic/6413228358.html","postedAt":"2017-12-05T14:21:50.000Z","updatedAt":"2017-12-11T20:57:34.000Z","images":["https://images.craigslist.org/00S0S_9zD6Miquqbr_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00K0K_apXdZqYcmTj_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00F0F_h3AcFKDYcTI_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00I0I_vwtSdRWfT8_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00g0g_dhRC3pQoTY3_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00909_7Ce6u5QVLCR_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00I0I_lXzRQk5nLoG_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00e0e_cHw4NuynIr9_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00B0B_bxS1oiKSgWS_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00C0C_kpSQd2UoTiR_600x450.jpg"],"attributes":{}},{"description":"QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nLooking for roomie in 20s\nBUSHWICK AND STANHOPE\n1 YEAR LEASE\nsmall room with closet in room share building\nsuper location and very convenient neighborhood\n\nkitchen has a fridge, microwave and hotplate \nhard wood floor\nsloped ceiling\nall utilities included\nEXCELLENT CREDIT (680+) AND INCOME (40X) OR USE A GUARANTOR\nsecurity, first month's rent and $60 app fee to move in\nEMAIL ME TO VIEW OR VIEW VIDEO","mapUrl":"https://maps.google.com/maps/preview/@40.690700,-73.927400,16z","pid":"6421590589","replyUrl":{"slashes":false,"protocol":"","hash":"","query":"","pathname":"/reply/nyc/roo/6421590589","auth":"","host":"","port":"","hostname":"newyork.craigslist.org","password":"","username":"","origin":"null","href":"/reply/nyc/roo/6421590589"},"title":"I'm looking for a TRUE minimalist for the last great priced room","url":"https://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/roo/d/im-looking-for-true/6421590589.html","postedAt":"2017-12-11T20:55:32.000Z","images":["https://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_lVoKGEStLSe_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00606_78cI37Mkllm_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00r0r_cvFvR11OfgA_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00n0n_1WdmtZbrQhc_600x450.jpg","https://images.craigslist.org/00s0s_YC5V0nX6Of_600x450.jpg"],"attributes":{}},{"description":"QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nWelcome to Riverdale's own River Point Towers!
